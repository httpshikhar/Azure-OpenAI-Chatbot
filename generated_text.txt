**Definition of Amoeba**

- Amoeba is a type of unicellular organism commonly found in pond water, wet soil, and other freshwater environments.
- Typically classified in the kingdom Protozoa, amoebas are part of the Amoebozoa group.

**Physical Characteristics**

- Shape: Amoeba exhibits a flexible and changing body shape owing to the absence of a rigid cell wall.
- Size: Most species measure between 0.1 to 0.5 mm in size, generally visible under a light microscope.
  
**Structure**

- Cell Membrane: Surrounds the cell, controlling the entry and exit of substances.
- Cytoplasm: Divided into the clearer ectoplasm and granular endoplasm, facilitating movement and the distribution of organelles.
- Nucleus: Contains genetic material; regulation of growth, metabolism, and reproduction.
- Organelles: Includes structures like mitochondria for energy, and vacuoles for digestion and excretion.

**Mode of Nutrition**

- Amoeba feeds on microscopic organisms such as bacteria and algae by phagocytosis.
  - Surrounds food with its body to form a food vacuole.
  - Digestive enzymes within the vacuole break down the food for absorption.
  
**Reproduction**

- Primarily reproduces asexually through a process called binary fission.
  - The nucleus divides first, followed by the division of the cytoplasm.
  - Results in two genetically identical amoebas.

**Movement**

- Utilizes pseudopodia ('false feet') for movement and capturing food.
  - Extends part of its body to anchor itself then pulls the rest of the body forward.
  
**Habitats and Adaptations**

- Prefers freshwater and moist soil environments.
- Adapted to osmotic changes in its environment using contractile vacuoles to expel excess water.

**Role in the Ecosystem**

- Predator of bacteria and other microbial organisms.
- A food source for larger organisms like water mites and small fishes.
  
**Pathogenic Species**

- While most amoebas are harmless, some species like *Entamoeba histolytica* can cause diseases such as amoebiasis or amoebic dysentery in humans.

**Research and Studies**

- Scientists study amoebas to understand basic cell processes and human immune responses.
- They are also used in assessing water quality and soil health.
