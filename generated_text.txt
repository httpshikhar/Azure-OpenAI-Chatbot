### Three Laws of Motion by Sir Isaac Newton

**1. First Law of Motion (Law of Inertia):**
   - **Definition:** An object at rest stays at rest, and an object in motion continues in motion with the same speed and in the same direction unless acted upon by an unbalanced force.
   - **Explanation:**
     - This law means that if the total force acting on an object is zero, its velocity will not change, implying constant motion or stillness.
     - **Example:** A book lying on a table remains at rest until someone picks it up, showcasing inertia in a state of rest. Similarly, a hockey puck sliding on ice will continue sliding in the same direction and at constant speed if no forces like friction or a stick intervene.

**2. Second Law of Motion (Law of Acceleration):**
   - **Definition:** The acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. This is mathematically expressed as \( F = ma \), where \( F \) is the net force, \( m \) is the mass, and \( a \) is the acceleration.
   - **Explanation:**
     - This implies that an object’s acceleration increases with a greater force and decreases with greater mass.
     - **Example:** Pushing a car and a bicycle with the same amount of force results in the bicycle accelerating more than the car because the mass of the bicycle is less than that of the car.

**3. Third Law of Motion (Action and Reaction Law):**
   - **Definition:** For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
   - **Explanation:**
     - This law means that interactions between two objects are mutual, with each object exerting a force on the other that is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction.
     - **Example:** When you jump off a boat onto a dock, you push against the boat as you leap, and the boat pushes back with an equal force in the opposite direction. This reaction force might cause the unanchored boat to move away from the dock.

Each of these laws plays a crucial role in understanding the physical dynamics of objects we observe in daily life and advanced applications in physics and engineering.
